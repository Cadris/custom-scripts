# Custom-Scripts

I am using this repo to Keep the collections of All the custom Scripts I create.

I am fine with any one using this, just remenber whatever you do is upto you, and I am not responsible for any of your actions.

All the diferent projects have their seperate folders, which contains their own documentaions.

Note : Press the `.` button on keyboard to open VS Code in browser for a better view.
